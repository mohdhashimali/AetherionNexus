# Blockchain-Based Real Estate Tokenization Platform

## Overview
The **Blockchain-Based Real Estate Tokenization Platform** is a cutting-edge decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize the real estate industry. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform enables fractional ownership, secure transactions, and transparent property management using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Traditionally, real estate investments are limited to high-net-worth individuals due to large capital requirements, slow transactions, and intermediary involvement. This platform democratizes access to real estate investment by tokenizing properties, making them accessible to a broader audience. 

This system eliminates the reliance on centralized authorities, reducing transaction costs and increasing trust. Using Ethereum smart contracts, all transactions are automated, ensuring seamless property transfers and revenue distribution. MetaMask integration allows users to interact with the blockchain securely, while Hardhat and Ganache provide a robust development and testing environment. 

This project is ideal for real estate investors, property developers, and blockchain enthusiasts looking for a transparent and efficient way to invest in property assets. 

## Features
- **Tokenization of Real Estate Assets**: Convert properties into blockchain-based tokens.
- **Fractional Ownership**: Investors can buy a fraction of a property instead of full ownership.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate transactions, ownership transfers, and income distribution.
- **Decentralized & Transparent**: Secure and immutable property records using blockchain.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Secure login and transaction signing via Ethereum wallets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily list, invest, and trade tokenized assets.
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Eliminates intermediaries and reduces fees.
- **Security & Compliance**: Implements cryptographic security and smart contract validation.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Blockchain Tools**: Hardhat, GANACHE, MetaMask
- **Database/Host**: Solidity
- **Payment Processing**: TESTETH â€“ MetaMask

## Installation

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/real-estate-tokenization.git
   cd real-estate-tokenization
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
3. **Run Ganache:**
   ```sh
   ganache-cli
   ```
4. **Copy the Private Key** from Ganache and paste it in `hardhat.config.cjs`.
   ```sh
   Example: 0xe4925a93bc35e270aca3f04772388aa67e0709815b5280b62e5feeb5491f0843
   ```
5. **Run Hardhat Tests:**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat test
   ```
6. **Deploy Smart Contracts on the Ganache Network:**
   ```sh
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ganache
   ```
   Copy these values and paste them in `contractConfig.js`:
   ```sh
   RealEstate contract deployed at: 0xE06F600C9300D03Be385035ff645fd54abeCE3F8 (Example)
   Transaction contract deployed at: 0x8bd2De6f097f590B3fA34fE60B4f7Df5a627e424 (Example)
   ```
7. **Copy another Ganache Private Key and create an account in MetaMask.**
8. **Run the Project:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
9. **Access the DApp and Buy Tokenized Properties!**

## Smart Contract Details
- **RealEstateToken.sol**: ERC-721 contract for property representation.
- **TokenSale.sol**: Manages fractional ownership and investment.
- **RevenueDistribution.sol**: Automates rental income distribution to investors.

## Testing
To verify the system's functionality, execute:
```sh
npx hardhat test
```
This tests:
- Token minting and transfers
- Ownership verification
- Smart contract interactions

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-chain Support**: Extend support to Binance Smart Chain & Polygon.
- **AI-based Property Valuation**: Implement AI-driven property pricing mechanisms.
- **Mobile App**: Develop an Android/iOS application for better accessibility.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Integrate KYC & AML procedures for enhanced security.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement zero-knowledge proofs for better data privacy.
- **Fractional Ownership Trading**: Introduce a marketplace for trading fractional ownership tokens.
